ZXbug and mocoder are available from 
https://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/zx81/tape/

ZXBug is a powerfull debugger for zx81 occupies top 4K of RAM from 0x71E0
Mocoder is a really cool tool that compiles basic into machine code

Workflow to load mcoder, load basic program then compile and run then load debugger:
1) LOAD "MCODER"
2) RUN (normally this happens automatically)
3) LOAD BACIC PROGRAM (Has to include the first 4 lines still of the MCODER, so start at line 10 must end with STOP
4) change to SLOW mode
5) LET L=USR 17389   (runcs basic compiler, may have todo twice?)
6) after pressing O til ? and 0/0 displayed then 
   LET L=USR 18823 to run machine code version (hex 4987)
6) LOAD ZXBug  (will auto run)
    Commands
      Zxxxx yyyy    - disassemble between xxxx and yyyy
      D - display registers
      F - display flags
      Gxxxx - goto (run) machine code routine at xxxx, must return with RET at end
      Pxxxx - print block of 64 bytes
      X - exit
e.g.      
Z4987 49EB print 64 bytes from where MCoder puts the "compiled" basic code 
      
7) if exited (using X command) then re-run ZXBug with PRINT
