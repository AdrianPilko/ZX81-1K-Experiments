# ZX81- assembly code
This repo started out as 1k compatible programs but now only a few are, some need 16k

Currently these program files, most are 16k not 1k

     chessBoard.asm - prints some text and a chess board

     tetris.asm   - a tetris clone 1k attempt (incomplete)

     tetris16K.asm - more complete tetris

     doodle16K.asm - move a box around draw shapes

     snake16K.asm - a snake game

     breakoutToniBaker.asm - a classic breakout game from book - Mastering Machine code on your zx81, by Toni Baker. I had to fix what I am sure waa a bug in the original listing. The main problem was how the next ball direction was determined.
